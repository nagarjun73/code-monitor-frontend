**Code Monitor App**

Developed a full-stack Code Monitor App designed for hosts to efficiently monitor participants' code. This app provides a centralized platform for hosts to oversee and evaluate participants' coding activities. I have used socket.io and monaco-editor for real-time code monitoring, the ability to view and assess code summaries.
